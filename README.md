1. Axiomatic Design

Decouple the design to make it optimizable. Real devices are multiphysics. E.g. mechanic, mechatronic, optoelectronic.

2. Robust Design

Systemic approach. It is a requirements flowdown into subsystems. It uses Taguchi Design philosophy.

3. New kid on the block

Quantum Approach to search for initial state under noise ("learning with errors")[https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063].
